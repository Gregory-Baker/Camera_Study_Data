# Camera Study

Participant Feedback


## Participant 1

#### Trial 1: Stereo Camera with VR

Ignored the map again, but this time it felt less useful as easier to scan the environment. Seems like sometimes frames are not quite as smooth as on-screen 

#### Trial 2: Camera with Manual Pan-tilt

I would have done better if I'd been more aware of the little map with obstacles (my fault for not noticing it)

#### Trial 3: 360 Degree Camera

Better resolution, particularly when grabbing and stacking the cylinders (hard to tell where the grasper is relative to the cylinders)


## Participant 2

#### Trial 1: Camera with Manual Pan-tilt

Didn't realise how much the VR depth perception was helping until it was removed. have to use other method such as shadows and contact to judge depth.

#### Trial 2: Stereo Camera with VR

Arm continues to move once control input has been released/stopped. This can make fine control difficult when not used to system.

#### Trial 3: 360 Degree Camera

Like having the mini-map stay in constant location rather than moving with view

#### Overall Feedback:

Only VR depth perception allowed positioning of the containers correctly first time. With the other cameras I relied on contact and iterative movement for accurate positioning. If this is not taken into account the positioning data alone may not be as useful.


## Participant 3

#### Trial 1: 360 Degree Camera

adding stereo vision could help have a better depth perception. 

#### Trial 2: Camera with Manual Pan-tilt

difficult to have depth perception. if using screen-based system multiple camera would help. 

#### Trial 3: Stereo Camera with VR

best depth perception but the objects were of unrealistic scales looking smaller than real life.  

#### Overall Feedback:

seems like a very interesting and promising system. good luck!


## Participant 4

#### Trial 1: Stereo Camera with VR

This interface felt more real

#### Trial 2: 360 Degree Camera

The task would have been easier of I had proximity information of the gripper to horizontal surfaces

#### Trial 3: Camera with Manual Pan-tilt

Camera tilt with head movements

#### Overall Feedback:

no


## Participant 5

#### Trial 1: 360 Degree Camera


#### Trial 2: Stereo Camera with VR


#### Trial 3: Camera with Manual Pan-tilt

my muscle memory wanted to use the second analogue stick to pan the camera, but that's just a result of playing video games


## Participant 6

#### Trial 1: Camera with Manual Pan-tilt

Room lighting is very even, difficult to use lighting changes to determine location of objects. LEDs on gripper arm and front of robot would maybe help locate objects better

#### Trial 2: 360 Degree Camera

some indication of distance to objects/areas

#### Trial 3: Stereo Camera with VR

I don't think I used the picture-in-picture at all for this one. Not distracting, but felt more confident locating objects/judging distances


## Participant 7

#### Trial 1: Stereo Camera with VR

Much easier with stereo vision but there was some discomfort when moving the robot and my head at the same time. It would be helpful to move the camera in position as well as orientation also.

#### Trial 2: Camera with Manual Pan-tilt

Stereo vision for depth information. Maybe a representation of the arm to show configuration from another angle

#### Trial 3: 360 Degree Camera

360 was good for navigation but lack of stereo vision made manipulation difficult. There was also a noticeable delay in the camera feed which made small, accurate movements difficult.

#### Overall Feedback:

A hybrid of 360 for navigation and stereo for manipulation would have worked well for me, as sickness effects were only apparent if I was moving the mobile platform at the same time as moving my head. 


## Participant 8

#### Trial 1: Camera with Manual Pan-tilt


#### Trial 2: 360 Degree Camera

An indicator of how close the arm is to singularity might have been useful.

#### Trial 3: Stereo Camera with VR

Significantly easier to pick up/manipulate the barrels than the other conditions, but moving around felt trickier and caused slight nausea.


## Participant 9

#### Trial 1: 360 Degree Camera

latency issue. others all good 

#### Trial 2: Stereo Camera with VR

arm could be more precise! but it is alright now tho

#### Trial 3: Camera with Manual Pan-tilt

camera control could be placed somewhere else or had another system to control

#### Overall Feedback:

Idea: camera control using spectacle/head movement & control using computer 


## Participant 10

#### Trial 1: 360 Degree Camera

camera delay didn't help, but it is easy to get used to after a minute. Same issue as before with there being no reference frame/camera so you can't tell how far out the arm is

#### Trial 2: Camera with Manual Pan-tilt

Another camera to get the perspective of the arm as the reach out requires judgement 

#### Trial 3: Stereo Camera with VR

The 3D vision was a lot better and easier to see how far the arm was reached out. I had to keep my head still as the movement inside the headset was not matching my head movements which would definitely cause sickness to the untrained in VR. If that can be fixed it would be perfect 

#### Overall Feedback:

The stereo camera was by far the best, but needs to be working in unison with head movements to avoid sickness 


## Participant 11

#### Trial 1: Camera with Manual Pan-tilt


#### Trial 2: Stereo Camera with VR


#### Trial 3: 360 Degree Camera

Lots of eye strain due to poor image quality and difficulty with depth perception. Very frustrating at times


## Participant 12

#### Trial 1: Stereo Camera with VR

The little map on the top left was useful to navigate and avoid obstacles. 

#### Trial 2: 360 Degree Camera

Maybe have the same button for open/close gripper (press once to open then again to close). Was fun driving the robot around

#### Trial 3: Camera with Manual Pan-tilt

I think VR was easier to control/navigate the robot 

#### Overall Feedback:

I felt the immersion with VR made it easier to control the robot


## Participant 13

#### Trial 1: Stereo Camera with VR

Camera shaking causes headache 

#### Trial 2: Camera with Manual Pan-tilt

depth perception was hard from one point of view

#### Trial 3: 360 Degree Camera

apart from lag and blur image, the system was easy to use


## Participant 14

#### Trial 1: Camera with Manual Pan-tilt

Found it confusing that objects behind the system weren't mapped, depth was still tricky to gauge 

#### Trial 2: 360 Degree Camera

less lag  between camera and movement and better depth perception on camera

#### Trial 3: Stereo Camera with VR

motion sickness was the worst when using this system. also found it hard to judge depth and knocked over a barrel. Having a the object detection on the rear of robot could help

#### Overall Feedback:

the slam map in the corner was very useful but could do with being 360 or remembering positions when hidden from camera


## Participant 15

#### Trial 1: Camera with Manual Pan-tilt

Have a safe position for arm so its harder to crash the arm into something.

#### Trial 2: Stereo Camera with VR

Some feedback from the robot on the stacking task at the end of the test would have been nice

#### Trial 3: 360 Degree Camera


#### Overall Feedback:

Time delay was not as difficult to adjust to as I initially though. The shake on the stereo cameral felt like it was more than the other two. Controller took a little getting used to but it was not difficult to use.


## Participant 16

#### Trial 1: 360 Degree Camera

The lag does make it more difficult to perform fine adjustments.

#### Trial 2: Camera with Manual Pan-tilt

Some way of perceiving depth/ where the gripper is hovering over? A laser pointing down or something? 

#### Trial 3: Stereo Camera with VR



## Participant 17

#### Trial 1: 360 Degree Camera

maybe have minimap positioned lower for this case so that it is easy to focus on it despite camera lag

#### Trial 2: Stereo Camera with VR

level indicators to indicate horizon/90 degree.

#### Trial 3: Camera with Manual Pan-tilt

nothing in particular

#### Overall Feedback:

The experiment was a really fun one!


## Participant 18

#### Trial 1: Stereo Camera with VR


#### Trial 2: 360 Degree Camera

spinning on the chair reduced the dizziness

#### Trial 3: Camera with Manual Pan-tilt



## Participant 19

#### Trial 1: Stereo Camera with VR


#### Trial 2: Camera with Manual Pan-tilt

Arm was blocking the camera view

#### Trial 3: 360 Degree Camera

The delay made it much harder to navigate 


## Participant 20

#### Trial 1: Camera with Manual Pan-tilt

easy to operate. matter of getting used to the joystick with its various controls. strenuous on the eyes for continuous operation, do need to lace with suitable breaks 

#### Trial 2: 360 Degree Camera

initially found it challenging to get feel the 3D perspective, took a few iterations to ensure gripper positions correctly. matter of god training and practice. I also  think people with impaired vision might need a few breaks and the human factor of continuous operation needs to be thought of.

#### Trial 3: Stereo Camera with VR

very realistic and attractive interface. feels intuitive with the head movement and judging position. need breaks from continuous use to limit eye and neck strain.


## Participant 21

#### Trial 1: 360 Degree Camera

Hard to tell distances and position of gripper at times

#### Trial 2: Stereo Camera with VR

It would be nice to  be able to switch to the camera on gripper to see what and how you are gripping.

#### Trial 3: Camera with Manual Pan-tilt


#### Overall Feedback:

more obstacles? 


## Participant 22

#### Trial 1: Stereo Camera with VR

add an additional light source so that the operator can use the shadows to estimate the depth

#### Trial 2: 360 Degree Camera

Maybe add an additional camera(or a depth camera) in the front of the vehicle 

#### Trial 3: Camera with Manual Pan-tilt



## Participant 23

#### Trial 1: 360 Degree Camera

Overlay camera from gripper, or distance sensor readings.

#### Trial 2: Camera with Manual Pan-tilt

Slight delay in robot response to controller input may be troubling if not used to controller/no video game experience.

Camera looking down from gripper would allow easier gripping

#### Trial 3: Stereo Camera with VR

Stereo camera alleviated somewhat the problems with distance from gripper to barrel due to depth perception. 

Looking down allows vision to be blacked out rather than limiting movement

#### Overall Feedback:

Switching controller type ie. joystick/keyboard may prevent people learning the route to prevent subsequent attempt being easier.


## Participant 24

#### Trial 1: Camera with Manual Pan-tilt

Even harder than the VR to gauge height of barrels relative to one another

#### Trial 2: Stereo Camera with VR

Being able to move the camera in more directions (ie to assess the distance between objects when placing one on top of another)

#### Trial 3: 360 Degree Camera

Slight lag in robot response, but very impressive overall


## Participant 25

#### Trial 1: Stereo Camera with VR

The map was nice & would be welcome in unfamiliar environments.
The ability to move the camera itself would be nice (although might be uncomfortable to operate.
Found myself using the tank tracks of the vehicle to change the orientation of the arm rather than the arm itself.

#### Trial 2: Camera with Manual Pan-tilt

Better Depth Perception
Sound Integration (If I couldn't hear it in the lab)
Lighting on the vehicle perhaps?

#### Trial 3: 360 Degree Camera

Delay made it quite difficult.


#### Overall Feedback:

The fact the vehicle and the robot can both move in xy could be overkill except for in niche scenarios where the robot wouldn't be able to pivot/precise movements are required. 
Overall very impressed with the system's usability.


## Participant 26

#### Trial 1: Camera with Manual Pan-tilt

faster camera movement or synchronous camera movement with car movement. 

#### Trial 2: 360 Degree Camera

no delays

#### Trial 3: Stereo Camera with VR

Shaky camera. Touch alert. various angle cameras

#### Overall Feedback:

system need to be a lot more responsive without delays


## Participant 27

#### Trial 1: 360 Degree Camera

Definitely more difficult to understand where end effector was relative to objects in space without using learnt spatial ques

#### Trial 2: Stereo Camera with VR

Maybe adjustable POV e.g. slightly movable camera as I felt like I needed to look down more than I could.

#### Trial 3: Camera with Manual Pan-tilt

Definitely the easiest view for driving and second best for positioning objects. Stereo wins on positioning but not as easy to drive with


## Participant 28

#### Trial 1: 360 Degree Camera

remove the delay in image transmission

#### Trial 2: Camera with Manual Pan-tilt

a camera mounted low such that you can see when the grasped object is touching the floor

#### Trial 3: Stereo Camera with VR

the camera should not shake so much


## Participant 29

#### Trial 1: Camera with Manual Pan-tilt

It needs some practice with positioning the objects on the targets

#### Trial 2: Stereo Camera with VR

Vision clarity - VR realism

#### Trial 3: 360 Degree Camera

There is some fatigue at the third trial. If this was done first it might be easier but I still think it was the hardest of the three systems to use

#### Overall Feedback:

VR method - was hard to see the floor near the robot but could be just familiarity.


## Participant 30

#### Trial 1: Stereo Camera with VR

Nope, I got used to the difference in the shoulder and trigger buttons

#### Trial 2: 360 Degree Camera

If the Enable drive and Enable Arm both the shoulder button or the trigger button. 

#### Trial 3: Camera with Manual Pan-tilt



## Participant 31

#### Trial 1: Stereo Camera with VR

Much better than computer screen in  terms of noticing the depths and being able to pick/place the barrels. 
Dizziness was very unconfortable
It gets easier with trials as you get to know more about how the robot behaves, for example the lag, and knowing the environment also helps move easier around
I think my hands might be a bit small and sometimes is difficult to keep all buttons pressed consistently

#### Trial 2: Camera with Manual Pan-tilt

Difficult to perceive depth

#### Trial 3: 360 Degree Camera

The lag in the images was a bit annoying
It was very difficult to perceive the depth to grasp/release the objects
I did not feel the need to use the map that was overlayed


## Participant 32

#### Trial 1: Camera with Manual Pan-tilt

Overall it was much easier to focus on the actual task, and the degree of separation (VR vs screen) made it feel a lot less "present" which I find makes it a lot easier to use - the eyestrain with VR (especially with the lag) detracts from it being immersive I find. The task was also familiar and I felt a bit more confident about the steps having completed them (sort of) once already. It was also way easier to gauge where the arm was in the z-axis.

#### Trial 2: 360 Degree Camera

Thought it worked pretty well despite the lag, but found moving in the z-axis really difficult to ascertain how far I'd moved for a given input. 

#### Trial 3: Stereo Camera with VR

Actually had confidence in where the end effector of the robot arm was, which I didn't in any of the other trials. The first 30 seconds felt really weird, but after that I didn't notice the dizziness so much. 


## Participant 33

#### Trial 1: 360 Degree Camera

I think the camera placement was the biggest problem. It was too high. The delay didn't help either.

#### Trial 2: Stereo Camera with VR


#### Trial 3: Camera with Manual Pan-tilt

Camera placement could have been lower.


## Participant 34

#### Trial 1: Camera with Manual Pan-tilt

same comments as before

#### Trial 2: Stereo Camera with VR

more intuitive controller, camera view from the tool

#### Trial 3: 360 Degree Camera

same as previous, but would benefit from higher res camera with lower latency


## Participant 35

#### Trial 1: Stereo Camera with VR

Better video (less double vision)

#### Trial 2: 360 Degree Camera

Deepness was the hardest part (rely on arm shadow)

#### Trial 3: Camera with Manual Pan-tilt

Require an additional camera to better know the location of the arm vs the object


## Participant 36

#### Trial 1: 360 Degree Camera

camera lag was annoying

#### Trial 2: Camera with Manual Pan-tilt

I found hard to figure out depths

#### Trial 3: Stereo Camera with VR

I loved it

#### Overall Feedback:

great experiment!


## Participant 37

#### Trial 1: Camera with Manual Pan-tilt


#### Trial 2: 360 Degree Camera


#### Trial 3: Stereo Camera with VR



## Participant 38

#### Trial 1: Stereo Camera with VR

Much easier to judge perspective and position both the robot and the arm accurately. But the picture vibrated a lot.

#### Trial 2: Camera with Manual Pan-tilt

Very difficult to judge perspective. I did keep getting up/down confused (albeit temporarily) on the robot arm.

#### Trial 3: 360 Degree Camera

Better than the PTZ camera, worse than the other VR system. Picture was very grainy, which was quite annoying. Colour resolution was the best of the three (which helped to identify objects more easily). Depth perception better than the PTZ camera but not quite as good as the other VR system.


## Participant 39

#### Trial 1: 360 Degree Camera


#### Trial 2: Stereo Camera with VR

Proximity alerts

#### Trial 3: Camera with Manual Pan-tilt

Second camera for judging height of barrels when placing down


## Participant 40

#### Trial 1: 360 Degree Camera

It is quite difficult to estimate the height of the robotic arm as VR only allow me to look from the above. If there is another camera at the robotic arm and the option to switch to that camera, the task might be able to complete with more accuracy and less time.

#### Trial 2: Camera with Manual Pan-tilt

It is a bit difficult to see the task objects if the robotic arm was fully stretch in front of the camera since the arm will block the vision of the task object. It might be easier if there are multiple camera view at the robotic arm.

#### Trial 3: Stereo Camera with VR

This interface is the easiest way to complete the task among three experiments. The estimation of the height is still a bit difficult, but much easier than the previous two. As it is easier to control, the task accuracy is the highest while taking less time to complete, suffering less motion sickness.

#### Overall Feedback:

Using the gamepad controller to control the robotic arm in a specific direction was a good option for me. If the VR controller is used instead (in Paul's experiment), it would be a way more difficult as there will be a lot of singularities occur which frustrated me a lot. 


## Participant 41

#### Trial 1: Camera with Manual Pan-tilt


#### Trial 2: Stereo Camera with VR

Lag is a bit too evident and can result uncomfortable


#### Trial 3: 360 Degree Camera

Brightness of the camera was excessive, image trembling a lot and depth perception was very difficult, excessive lag


## Participant 42

#### Trial 1: Stereo Camera with VR

Only issue was with dizziness when turning my head during operation. Depth perception was great.

#### Trial 2: 360 Degree Camera

Hard to judge depth perception

#### Trial 3: Camera with Manual Pan-tilt

Some minor issues with depth perception. Spatial awareness was more difficult, especially when turning the robot and navigating between obstacles.
